% Matlab Intro 
\chapter{MATLAB Structure and Use}

This first laboratory session is an introduction to the MATLAB programming suite.  Basic interface, operations, functions, and programming techniques are covered.  Students will complete tasks that exemplify the advantages of using MATLAB in engineering modeling, testing, and analysis.
\par
Many of the key features---some would say \textit{quirks}---of MATLAB are described in detail in Appendix \ref{app:matlaboverview}.  Students should first consult this appendix to ensure that they are familiar enough with MATLAB to complete this experiment.
